When you ask the wizard in this cave to play a game of NIM he will
arrange a number of piles, each of which has any number of pebbles in.
You have the first move, where a move consists of removing any number
of pebbles from a single pile. This can be done by saying remove n from
m. To win the game you must remove the last pebble.  You may see the
state of play at any time during the game by typing piles." ;
