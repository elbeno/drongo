==========

Here is the code I have been writing over the last few months. It
is the start of an island to replace/be the second island. The code
currently includes only one puzzle but will hopefully have four
more added to it (making a total of five). I do have plans for these
and have made most of the island accordingly. I have not made
the village because this involves slightly more work, but have left
room for it and prevented players getting there. 

Currently the code sent consists of the basic island locations and
a wizard tower. This has a puzzle in it, as described below. This
all currently works under Drongo (as Boro calls it). It also contains
a room for myself, and a control room for the puzzle.

There are a few things that i think you need to do:
  - what should happen when the player choses the wrong solution to the
    door puzzle. More about this in the source code.

Below is a breif description of the puzzles (including those I intend to
add)

I hope the code is in the 'Drogon' standard, and that it is OK. The code
for the puzzle is long, but the function to reset the puzzle is compilcated.

I have turned the island around so that one of the locations is facing
west. This is location island2_beach_03. I have added rocks to the other
beach locations so there is a reason why you cannot land on them.

Logic Island
============

The Room Puzzle
---------------

To be found in the wizard tower.

In a room (The Puzzle Room) there are three exits, and a stone. Each
exit has a plaque as does the stone. The inscriptions on the door
plaques read one of the following:
  'The ingot is behind door X'
  'The ingot is not behind door X'
  'Plaque X lies'
  'Plaque X tells the truth'
And the plaque on the stone gives some indication of how many doors are
telling the truth. Depending on what ingot you are playing for (determined
by which are available) the inscriptions are of varying difficulty. There
are four possible treasures of increasing order and weight. The bronze,
silver, gold and platinum ingots. If you are playing for the platinum ingot
it is in the cleanres cupboard not any of the 'standard' doors and there
is no solution to the puzzle posed!
The idea is a good player will collect two ingots and then come back
for the other two. The bronze is very easy. The gold can be nasily hard
and the platinum (as mentioned above needs lateral thinking!

The pebble puzzle
-----------------

To be found in the cave. This will be a game of NIM.

The potion puzzle
-----------------

To be found in the forest.

The Dynamic maze
----------------

Unsure. Possibly on the sand!
