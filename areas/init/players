  Wearing comfortable clothing suited to the lifestyle of an adventurer, 
  she skips freely through the Land of Drogon. 
  The instant you hear her lyrical voice, you are put at ease. 
  Truth, beauty, and love envelop you in her presence. 
  She is a musician, an artist, a philosopher, and a friend. 
  She reminds you that it is not ones appearance, 
  but ones personality, which truly make up his/her being." ;
