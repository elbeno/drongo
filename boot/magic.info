  Drogon Magic
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~
  The land of Drogon is a magical place and there are a few magical
  spells that the ordinary Drogoneer can use.

  Most Drogon magic works by summoning a demon to do your dirty work.
  You may also find scrolls which contains magical text which will perform
  the magic directly by you when it is read. Your ability to perform magic
  depends on your level within the game. Generally speaking, wanderers
  will find it impossible to do magic, whereas wizards magic will never
  fail.

  The amount of magic that you can do is controlled by your mana. The
  more mana you have, the more spells you can do. Casting a spell will
  use up your mana, to the point that you will no-longer be able to do
  any magic. Casting a spell when you have insufficient mana will reduce
  your mana by about half of what the spell needs. Fortumately your mana
  value can't go below zero. Type "score" (or "sc") to see your current
  mana value and it's maximum possible value.

  Your mana regenerates with time. The higher your level, the faster it
  regenerates.

  Shout, tell and page are magical commands and will deplete your mana
  value accordingly, as is casting an earmuffs spell.

  Magical commands that exist within the land are:
    deafen, dumb, blind, paralyse, heal, fumble, summon,
    pWhere, oWhere and mWhere.

  Type "help <magical command>" for more details.
  (Wizards and witches can type "wHelp magic" for more details)
