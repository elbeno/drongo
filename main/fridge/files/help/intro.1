     to reference it. you only need to type enough characters to resolve any
     ambiguity. (Eg. you can type "read red" to read the Red neon sign.)
     Type "help names" for more information about object and player names
     and match strings.

   + Pseudopolis, the first town you encounter is a very safe place. No-one

     to explore the surrounding lands.
