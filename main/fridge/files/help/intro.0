  ~~~~~~
  In a nutshell, the aim of the game is to reach the rank of Wizard.

  To do this, you need money. The more money you have, the higher your level.
  The gods will give you money if you return to them treasure that is
  scattered through the land. Getting this treasure may be as simple as just
  picking it up, or you may have to solve puzzles, avoid traps and defend
  yourself from monsters and other players!

  You start your adventure in a town to the South: Pseudopolis. If you make
  your way to the library (to the West), you may find a rough map of the
  land pinned to the library wall.

  A few things of note:

   + The unit of currency is the pobblebead. You start with none, and you
     need one million to become a wizard or witch. You carry a magical purse
     with you at all times which contains your wealth.
