Someone (Irn-Bru) says: "Want to be an arch?"
You say: "Yeah ok"
Someone (Irn-Bru) waves his hands and mutters "Ratta-dob do me a frob" ...

Someone (Irn-Bru) says: "ok, Invis (0,1,2)"
Someone (Irn-Bru) says: "0 - no effect, 1 lightning, 2 hole in the ground"

You feel the earth under your feet rumble and shake a little. A hole
appears in the ground and out of the hole rises Irn-Bru!
Irn-Bru waves his hands and mutters "Zapadiz, make invis" ...

You see a bolt of lightning and hear a mighty thunderclap! When your eyes
and ears recover you notice Irn-Bru has vanished from sight!
Someone (Irn-Bru) says: "actually, the numbers only work with invis/vis - no Vi
s, Invis goes directly Invis with no effects."

  " you get to hear whispers too. don't mention this to anyone. "
Someone (Irn-Bru) says: "ban - ban a player - there is even help on it - awHelp
 ban"

  ban <player> <number of days>
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  This command bans a player from the game from 1 to 5 days. The player
  does not need to be online to ban him or her. Your ban action is logged
  and you must have good reason before banning a player. (You can-not
  cancel a ban).

  It is a good idea to leave me a NOTE when you ban someone.

  Note: If the players-name has spaces in it, you must enclose the name
        in double quotes.  Eg.  ban "foo bar" 4.

  Banning a player who is currently connected doesn't throw them out of
  the game. You may with to follow a BAN with a BOOT.
