This is version 2.3 of MUDCaller released 10/19/93. MUDCaller is a 
Telnet client for MSDOS designed specifically for MUDS. MUDCaller works over 
the Crynwr packet drivers on an ethernet network or SLIP. This features of
this client are:

GUI Environment
Multiple Windowed Sessions
Large scrollback buffers
Macros
Responses
Logging
Barebones telnet support.

If you use Trumpet, FTP, Telnet, PopMail, or Nupop from a PC you can probably 
use this program.

This fixes the last of the major problems (I hope) in all the previous 
versions of mudcaller. Including the problem with the maximum input string 
being 255 characters. The maximum input string is now infinite.
MudCaller will now connect to regular Telnet places like telnet. It doesn't
support any terminals (eg vt100) yet so it does not work all that well. 

Mudcaller v2.3 is available via ftp at:
wuarchive.wustl.edu
/pub/msdos_uploads/network
mudcal23.zip

Also, please feel free to email me and I'll send you a UUEncoded copy of 
Mudcaller v2.3
