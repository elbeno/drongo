
Drogon Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this directory you should find enough information to allow you to
create all the rooms, map, objects, mobiles, puzzles and traps that you
can possibly immagine.

Included is all the code for the monastery and the mansion. You may
want to examine these while looking at the Build files.

Included also (in the file u-code) is the u-code reference manual. This
was written by mjr who wrote the UberMUD server.
